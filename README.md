### Things I learned in this project

- This was my first fully frontend application and introduced me to jQuery
- Expanded my comfort with CSS and flexbox


### Issues faced during this project

- Getting comfortable with flexbox and understanding how to position things exactly where I wanted them
- Figuring out the logic to ensure the game would end whenever any of the possible win scnearios were met
  - This was an issue with when the dealer and player would each have hands that _could_ win and determining how the dealer should proceed


### Unresolved project items

- The "How to Play" section is empty
- I want to ensure the win logic is actually correct for all potential conditions
- Want to allow users the option to choose deck style
- Add betting mechanic?
